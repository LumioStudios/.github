> *Creative Solutions for Multiplayer Gaming – Focused on Mods and Immersive Player Experiences*

## A Note from the Founder  

When I started developing multiplayer projects, I asked myself a simple question:  
*Why does so much of modding and plugin development feel more like work than play?*  

I wanted to create a way to make life easier for developers—  
and give players experiences they'll never forget.  

That's how Lumio Studios came to be. Not out of a desire to deliver “more features,”  
but out of a dream to create **simple systems with a big impact**.  

We believe that **technology should be invisible** so that what remains is the **magic of the game**.  

Just as Miyamoto says that his ideas often come from childhood memories, or Masuda explains that Pokémon should always be a feeling of “togetherness,”  
Lumio Studios is also built on a memory:  

the feeling that multiplayer doesn't just mean playing together—it means **creating moments that last** together.  

And if even one player, somewhere in the world, has an unforgettable experience because of our work,  
then we've achieved our goal.

## Our Philosophy  

Lumio Studios stands for three simple principles:

1. **Simplicity for Developers**
Systems that are clear, understandable, and modular—so that every developer can get started right away.

2. **Immersion for Players**
Tools, engines, and ideas that not only support multiplayer, but bring it to life.  

3. **Longevity of Ideas**  
   Projects that not only work, but can grow – because they are built on solid foundations.

We are convinced that multiplayer goes far beyond simply playing together—it stands for shared experiences and creative development. At Lumio Studios, we view each of our projects as an exciting journey, a unique universe that players not only explore but also actively shape. Just as Nintendo has created fascinating worlds with Zelda and Pokémon, we strive to write new stories and open fresh chapters in the Minecraft universe.

## What We Build  

We create **systems and creative solutions** for multiplayer gaming.  
It's not about quantity or mere features, but about **quality, consistency, and experiences** that touch players and developers alike.

## Contribution  

External contributions are welcome—but only for projects that we explicitly release to the community.  
We believe that openness is most effective where vision and responsibility meet.
